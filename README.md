Installation
1. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
sh
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
2. Install required dependencies
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure your wallets and trading strategies
Edit config.json to add your wallets, tokens, and trading strategies.

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "wallets": [
        {
            "name": "Brian",
            "wallet_secret": [128, 45, 76, ...],
            "tokens": [
                {
                    "symbol": "SOL",
                    "buy_price": 80.0,
                    "strategy": {
                        "primary": "2x",
                        "on_fail": "momentum",
                        "on_success": "grid"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "symbol": "RAY",
                    "buy_price": 1.5,
                    "strategy": {
                        "primary": "rsi",
                        "on_fail": "volume"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
How It Works
The bot fetches real-time token prices from Jupiter Aggregator.
It dynamically loads the primary trading strategy for each token.
If the primary strategy fails (e.g., doesn't execute a trade when expected), an alternate strategy takes over.
If the primary strategy succeeds (e.g., a trade executes at the target price), an on-success strategy can activate.
The bot continuously monitors and executes trades every 60 seconds.
Available Trading Strategies
BaxBoxBot supports various trading strategies, stored in pluginrules/.

Strategy Name	Description
2x	Sells when price reaches 2X the buy price.
forever	Keeps trading continuously within a 10% range.
trailing	Sells if price drops 5% from the highest after buying.
mean	Buys when price drops 5% below the moving average, sells when it rises 5% above.
momentum	Buys when price increases 3% in a short time, sells if it drops.
grid	Places buy/sell orders at set price intervals (e.g., every 5%).
rsi	Uses Relative Strength Index (RSI) to determine buy/sell points.
time	Buys and sells at fixed time intervals.
volume	Buys when trading volume spikes, sells when it drops.
custom	Sells when price reaches a custom target percentage gain.
Strategy Chaining: Alternate Strategies on Fail/Success
BaxBoxBot now supports alternate strategies when a primary strategy either fails or succeeds.

How it Works
Each token in config.json can specify:
"primary" â†’ The main strategy.
"on_fail" â†’ The fallback strategy if the primary one doesnâ€™t trigger a trade.
"on_success" â†’ The follow-up strategy if a trade is successfully executed.
Example:
json
Copy
Edit
"strategy": {
    "primary": "rsi",
    "on_fail": "momentum",
    "on_success": "grid"
}
The bot first tries rsi.
If rsi doesnâ€™t trigger a trade, it switches to momentum.
If a trade executes successfully, the bot switches to grid.
Adding Custom Strategies
To create a new strategy, add a .py file inside pluginrules/ and define a function:

python
Copy
Edit
def should_trade(symbol, price, buy_price):
    if price <= buy_price:
        return "buy"
    elif price >= buy_price * 1.5:
        return "sell"
    return None
Then, update config.json to use the new strategy.

Running the Bot
Start the bot with:

sh
Copy
Edit
python3 baxboxbot.py
The bot will continuously monitor prices and execute trades every 60 seconds.
